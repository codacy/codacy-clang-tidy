# modernize-replace-disallow-copy-and-assign-macro

Finds macro expansions of `DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN(Type)` and replaces
them with a deleted copy constructor and a deleted assignment operator.

Before the `delete` keyword was introduced in C++11 it was common
practice to declare a copy constructor and an assignment operator as
private members. This effectively makes them unusable to the public API
of a class.

With the advent of the `delete` keyword in C++11 we can abandon the
`private` access of the copy constructor and the assignment operator and
delete the methods entirely.

When running this check on a code like this:

``` c++
class Foo {
private:
  DISALLOW_COPY_AND_ASSIGN(Foo);
};
```

It will be transformed to this:

``` c++
class Foo {
private:
  Foo(const Foo &) = delete;
  const Foo &operator=(const Foo &) = delete;
};
```

## Known Limitations

- Notice that the migration example above leaves the `private` access
  specification untouched. You might want to run the check
  `modernize-use-equals-delete
  <../modernize/use-equals-delete>` to get warnings for deleted
  functions in private sections.

## Options
