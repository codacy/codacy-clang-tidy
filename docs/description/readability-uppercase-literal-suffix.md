# readability-uppercase-literal-suffix

<span class="title-ref">cert-dcl16-c</span> redirects here as an alias
for this check. By default, only the suffixes that begin with `l` (`l`,
`ll`, `lu`, `llu`, but not `u`, `ul`, `ull`) are diagnosed by that
alias.

Detects when the integral literal or floating point (decimal or
hexadecimal) literal has a non-uppercase suffix and provides a fix-it
hint with the uppercase suffix.

All valid combinations of suffixes are supported.

``` c
auto x = 1;  // OK, no suffix.

auto x = 1u; // warning: integer literal suffix 'u' is not upper-case

auto x = 1U; // OK, suffix is uppercase.

...
```

## Options

<div class="option">

NewSuffixes

Optionally, a list of the destination suffixes can be provided. When the
suffix is found, a case-insensitive lookup in that list is made, and if
a replacement is found that is different from the current suffix, then
the diagnostic is issued. This allows for fine-grained control of what
suffixes to consider and what their replacements should be.

</div>

### Example

Given a list \`L;uL\`:

- `l` -\> `L`
- `L` will be kept as is.
- `ul` -\> `uL`
- `Ul` -\> `uL`
- `UL` -\> `uL`
- `uL` will be kept as is.
- `ull` will be kept as is, since it is not in the list
- and so on.

<div class="option">

IgnoreMacros

If this option is set to non-zero (default is
<span class="title-ref">1</span>), the check will not warn about literal
suffixes inside macros.
