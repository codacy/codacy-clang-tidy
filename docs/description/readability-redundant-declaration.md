readability-redundant-declaration
=================================

Finds redundant variable and function declarations.

    extern int X;
    extern int X;

becomes

    extern int X;

Such redundant declarations can be removed without changing program
behaviour. They can for instance be unintentional left overs from
previous refactorings when code has been moved around. Having redundant
declarations could in worst case mean that there are typos in the code
that cause bugs.

Normally the code can be automatically fixed, `clang-tidy` can remove
the second declaration. However there are 2 cases when you need to fix
the code manually:

-   When the declarations are in different header files;
-   When multiple variables are declared together.
