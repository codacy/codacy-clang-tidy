# cert-err09-cpp

The cert-err09-cpp check is an alias, please see
[misc-throw-by-value-catch-by-reference](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/misc-throw-by-value-catch-by-reference.html)
for more information.

This check corresponds to the CERT C++ Coding Standard recommendation
ERR09-CPP. Throw anonymous temporaries. However, all of the CERT
recommendations have been removed from public view, and so their
justification for the behavior of this check requires an account on
their wiki to view.
