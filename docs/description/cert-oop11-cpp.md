cert-oop11-cpp
==============

The cert-oop11-cpp check is an alias, please see
[performance-move-constructor-init](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/performance-move-constructor-init.html)
for more information.

This check corresponds to the CERT C++ Coding Standard recommendation
OOP11-CPP. Do not copy-initialize members or base classes from a move
constructor. However, all of the CERT recommendations have been removed
from public view, and so their justification for the behavior of this
check requires an account on their wiki to view.
